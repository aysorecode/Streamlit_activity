  For this activity 1 problem, i create first i isntall python then component of streamlit to make import run then create a file named app1.py then input the basic structure of the app like "st.title","st.header" and also to input something i put the "st.text_input" for string and "st.number_input" for integers and others like "min_value:" minimum number allowed,"max_value:" maximum number allowed,"step:" how much the number increases or decreases when clicking arrows this all for filtering,As soon as you type a name (e.g., "jerick and 20"), you will get the output

 Same as activity 1 i import the "import streamlit as st" and then this "import pandas as pd" because were going to load data like a csv file by using "pd.read_csv" and then displaying it using "st.dataframe" i add filtering for better interaction to help user look for specific thing in file
